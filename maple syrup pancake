# PANCAKES-THE-ROCK-STYLE




Ingredients:-

1 1/4 cups flour                            
2 Tbsps.sugar                                   
2 tsps. baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 egg, beaten
1 cup milk
1 tbsp cooking oil
2 bananas (optional)
choco chip(optional)
maple syrup(at the end on top)


Directions:-

1. In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

2. In a seperate bowl, combine the egg, milk, and oil. Add this all at once 
    to the flour mixture, stirring until blended but still slightly lumpy.
    
3. For a standard- size pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter onto a hot,
    lightly greased griddle or a heavy skillet. For a dollar-sized pancake, 
    use only about 1 Tbsp. of batter.
    
4. Cook the pancakes until golden brown, flipping them over when they have
    a bubbly surface and slightly dry edges.
    
5. To make The Rock's favorite kind of pancakes, slice the bananas into 
    1/4-inch slices and place them in between the layers of the pancakes.
